# deep-learning-with-python-notes

Notes and code samples I created while reading the first edition of "Deep Learning With Python" book: https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python

All code samples that using Tensorflow during the practice is using `TensorFlow 2` while the author is using `TensorFlow 1.x` in the book.
